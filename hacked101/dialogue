Hi sir I am here for the project

mentor
Hi <student_name> thanks for showing up the interest

Have you ever heard about the word “Hacking” ?

student
yes, I have sir

mentor
Do you know exactly how people do it or how to fix “if Hacked” ?

student
No sir

mentor
Okay that’s not a problem lets get started with a super simple project to make you understand ‘Hacking’.

student
yes sir, this project looks very interesting (edited)

mentor
Let’s consider a senario you are a fitness Model, and Influencer, have 100,000+ subscribers on your website getting access to the paid content.

student
ok sir

mentor
One Day you woke up & got to check your email. You have recieved a lot of mails that your subscribers aren’t able to access your website content.

mentor
You got to check the Website and it shows a Deface content that “it’s Hacked”

student
which website sir

mentor
its projects.cclub.io:3000

student
got it sir
It shows some hacked message
What should I do now

mentor
Give me your inputs how do you think you’r gonna fixit?

student
I don’t know sir

mentor
Okay no problem we together gonna look how to fix it.
can you find ip address of a domain say for instance “projects.cclub.io”

student
sir ping kr ke mil jayega ip to

but sir college mein to ping nhi chlta

mentor
In case if you find it using ping it’s fine otherwise just google to find ip address using domain name “projects.cclub.io”

student
sorry sir could not find cclub.io

mentor
try using `nslookup` in case you don’t know go to http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/nslookup.htm

ok sir got the ip address

mentor
Do you know username and password the machine ?

student
no sir

mentor
We will use this for current session `username` and `password`

student
ok sir, but how do I login

what do I do with this username and password

mentor
you can login into the machine through `ssh` just by providing your `username` & `password`

student
what’s ssh

I am not able to understand anything

mentor
you can go through this to have a basic understanding about it, by the way it’s used for `remote login`.

SSH is an important tool used for administering remote Linux and Unix-like computers. In this guide, we will discuss the basic usage of this utility and how to configure your SSH environment. (71KB)

student
sir I am not able to understand this

mentor
okay no issues you have to do something like this in your `terminal` type `ssh remote_username@remote_host`

student
Possible problems

mentor
it will prompt you for password type it and you will be loggedIn

student
I have put the password pressed enter
what do I do now

mentor
your live code is in `projectsDir/app/`

student
ok sir I reached to the folder, I used cd command

mentor
Okay from now we will investigate what is the content your project is serving now.
do `nano index.html` to check the contents of html your project is serving.

student
did that sir

mentor
it must be showing hacked html content
there must be a backup directory having original `index.html`

student
it just shows html, how do I know if it is hacked (edited)

why only `index.html`

mentor
You will have to read the contents of it unless you won’t be able to figure it out if its right or wrong
also only `index.html` because it is the main HTML file we are rendering on website. so you have check for it’s content if its serving expected content.

student
ok sir so `index.html` is the hacked file
I also see another html file named `corrupted.html` what do I do with that
?
Should I remove the hacked `index.html` file

mentor
since you have figured out that `index.html` is hacked.
Might be possible someone specifically ‘Hacker’ moved the main content to `corrupted.html`.
In this case remove `index.html` and rename `corrupted.html` to `index.html`.
To remove `index.html` type `rm -rf index.html`
once that is removed type `mv corrupted.html index.html` this will move the contents of `corrupted.html` to `index.html`
now check for `projects.cclub.io:3000`. Congratulation you saved you ass  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: (edited)

student
Awesome sir this works
thanks
